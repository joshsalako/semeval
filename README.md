# POLAR at SemEval-2026

This repository contains the code and resources for our participation in the POLAR task at SemEval-2026, focusing on cross-lingual polarization detection in English and Hausa.

## Overview

Our approach compares three pretrained models for detecting and classifying polarized content in social media posts:
- AfriTeVa
- AfroXLMR-Social
- mDeBERTa-v3-base

The system addresses three subtasks:
1. Binary classification for polarization detection
2. Multi-label classification for Polarization Type Classification
3. Multi-label classification for polarization manifestations
